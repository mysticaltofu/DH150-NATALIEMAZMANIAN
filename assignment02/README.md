#### Introduction
 
For my usability testing, I chose to examine [The Museum of Jurassic Technology website](https://www.mjt.org/). This website serves as an online landing page for the Museum of Jurassic Technology, hosting different services such as the museum gift shop, visiting information, and details about various collections and exhibitions. The rationale behind my usability test was to see how a user interacted with various usability issues I discovered in my heuristic review.  Particularly, I wanted to see how the user would navigate between the main website and the other website that is consistently linked to. I also wanted to see how they would handle the lack of an undo button. The user's test of these features provides meaningful feedback that can help improve the website. The setting was at a residential home in Los Angeles, using a portable minimalistic lab.  The equipment used included two laptops as well as Zoom. Running my usability test over Zoom allowed me to eliminate physical proximity as a factor in finding participants. This was a pilot test to test the setting and materials. The process of the usability test included an orientation script, informed consent form, pre-test questionnaire, three tasks, post-test questionnaire (SUS), and demographic questions.  It measured ease of use of the website.

#### Summary/Reflection

During the pilot test, I learned that the participant might sometimes tell you more information than what was asked on the form. For example, my participant mentioned various aspects of the website's aesthetics, and if it were not for the recording, I would not have been able to record that information. It made me think that if I choose to conduct a test in person at some point, I need to make sure that I have the proper note taking set up to write everything down. Overall, the test went very wellâ€”my tasks and general instructions were interpreted by the participant successfully and I learned more about the difficulties of the webiste.  One thing that went not so well was that sometimes the entire Likert Scale was not able to be displayed at once. To fix this, I asked my participant to increase her window size once we made it to the post-test questions. To improve my usability testing in the future, I think I will focus on making sure my feedback is supportive but unbiased.
