# :link: Low Fidelity Prototype: Assignment 06

#### Overview
Brief summary of user-research, persona and three+ features you wrote as usage scenario; 

The purpose of low-fidelity prototyping here is to ensure that the new design flows I mocked up are actually intuitive to a user, before adding aesthetic elements. As a designer, it is easy to get caught up in your own design, as you are already familiar with where everything is. For this reason, it is important to engage in testing to ensure that the user experience is smooth and enjoyable.

My prototype supports three tasks (consisting of multiple interactions each): 
1. Planning a visit to the museum (task 1)
    * Hours (subtask)
    * Tickets
    * Directions & Parking
2. Watching the live Zoom lecture (task 2)
3. Learning more about an artifact (task 3)

#### Wireframes / Wireflow

#### Notes on Wireflow Testing
The tester successfully completed all the tasks. However, I noted that the beginning of my wireframe was a bit unclear, and it seemed that the tester leaned on the support of the wireflow arrows to decipher what he needed to do.

#### Reflection
Summary of the process, what went smoothly or differently from your expectation
What you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. 
For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype
