#### Overview
Brief summary of user-research, persona and three+ features you wrote as usage scenario; The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping
My prototype supports three tasks (consisting of multiple interactions each): 
* Planning a visit to the museum (task)
  1. Hours (subtask)
  2. Tickets
  3. Directions & Parking
* Watching the live Zoom lecture
* Learning more about an artifact

#### Wireframes / Wireflow

At least three distinctive wireframes (= sketches of the screen) that represent the user flow (the input and output of the system) 
+1: Thoughtful content design including proper texts and button labels

At least one sequence of the user interaction flow was presented with wireframes and arrow_lines 
+1: At least three features were presented via wireflow
+1: Complete interaction sequences for all the possible choices and exit/cancel/back were clearly presented via wireflow

#### Notes on Wireflow Testing
Note the tester’s confusion or unexpected interaction; Note whether the tester could successfully complete the tasks 
pictures/video of the tester’s walkthrough pathway


#### Reflection
Summary of the process, what went smoothly or differently from your expectation
What you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. 
For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype
