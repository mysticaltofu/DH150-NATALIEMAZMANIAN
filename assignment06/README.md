### Overview
#### Purpose of Low Fidelity Prototyping
The purpose of low-fidelity prototyping here is to ensure that the new design flows I mocked up are actually intuitive to a user, before adding aesthetic elements. As a designer, it is easy to get caught up in your own design, as you are already familiar with where everything is. For this reason, it is important to engage in testing to ensure that the user experience is smooth and enjoyable.

#### Three Supported Tasks
My wireframe/wireflow supports three tasks (consisting of multiple interactions each): 
1. Planning a visit to the museum (task 1)
    * Hours (subtask)
    * Tickets
    * Directions & Parking
2. Watching the live Zoom lecture (task 2)
3. Learning more about an artifact (task 3)

#### Summary of User Research/Personas
My user research thus far has focused on my expected userâ€”any individual who is inclined to visit a museum. I predict that this user will likely include mostly middle-aged/older adults. I predict that they will likely be educated, as they are using their free time to visit a museum. My user research has included an interview as well as usability testing of competing websites. Through user research thus far, I have found that individuals utilize museum websites both before and after their in person visit. Before, users are more interested in ticket information and deciding if they even want to go to the museum in the first place. After, users are more interested in following up what they learned with further research into the archive/collection. Moreover, the personas I developed for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/mysticaltofu/DH150-NATALIEMAZMANIAN/tree/main/assignment05). In summary, my personas cover a woman who is very involved with the museum as a volunteer, as well as an individual conducting research for school who is minimally involved.

### Wireframes / Wireflow

### Notes on Wireflow Testing
The tester successfully completed all the tasks. However, I noted that the beginning of my wireframe was a bit unclear, and it seemed that the tester leaned on the support of the wireflow arrows to decipher what he needed to do.

### Reflection
The process of testing my wireflows went very smoothly. Now that I reflect on my experience, it went almost too smoothly. I feel like I did not gain any insight into potential pain points of the website. For now, I will choose to believe that this is because the pain points are minimal, or dare I say, nonexistent (so far)! Overall, I was honestly dreading creating wireflows, but I actually had a lot of fun with it and enjoyed this necessary step of the process.
