#### Overview
Brief summary of user-research, persona and three+ features you wrote as usage scenario; The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping
My prototype supports three tasks (consisting of multiple interactions each): 
* Planning a visit to the museum (task)
  1. Hours (subtask)
  2. Tickets
  3. Directions & Parking
* Watching the live Zoom lecture
* Learning more about an artifact

#### Notes on Wireflow Testing
Note the tester’s confusion or unexpected interaction; Note whether the tester could successfully complete the tasks 
pictures/video of the tester’s walkthrough pathway


#### Reflection
Summary of the process, what went smoothly or differently from your expectation
What you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing. 
For each, describe in a sentence or two what problem the tester encountered, and in another sentence or two how you would address the problem if you were to revise the prototype
