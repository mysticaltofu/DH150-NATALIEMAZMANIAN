# High Fidelity Prototype: Assignment 07
## Natalie Mazmanian :book: Course: Digital Humanities 150 

### Description of Project: Purpose and Process
The purpose of prototyping, in my opinion, is to get a feel for how your website will actually function, as well as how it will look visually. Prototyping is such an important step in the design process as it marks when everything is truly coming to fruition in a form similar to what the end user might end up with. This stage of the design process starts to solidify your idea without setting any decisions in stone. It is important to remain flexible throughout the prototyping process and iterate through multiple times after getting feedback from testers.  Prototyping is also useful in mapping out the sequence of actions that users will go through to achieve tasks/goals.  Prototypes are also wonderful tools to use when testing with participants before any software development work has been done.

#### Three Supported Tasks
My wireframe/wireflow supports three tasks (consisting of multiple interactions each): 
1. Planning a visit to the museum (task 1)
    * Hours (subtask)
    * Tickets
    * Directions & Parking
2. Watching the live Zoom lecture (task 2)
3. Learning more about an artifact (task 3)

### Home Page Design Variations

Before settling on my final home page design, I went through a few iterations which are chronicled below.

#### Trial :one:

I began designing with the idea of using Armenian carpets in mind, as they are visually appealing and could be used to draw the user in. At first, I began with a home page with typical centered text:

![HomeCentered](https://github.com/mysticaltofu/DH150-NATALIEMAZMANIAN/blob/main/HomeCentered.png)

#### Trial :two:

Experimenting with different layouts, I attempted to feature one carpet and showcase it on the center of the page:

#### Trial :three:

Ultimately deciding that the design looked off balance and a bit too simple, I tried to do something more creative and experimented with a crossword design:

![HomeCrossword](https://github.com/mysticaltofu/DH150-NATALIEMAZMANIAN/blob/main/HomeCrossword.png)

#### Trial :four: - Final

This did not really work out very well, as the vertical text looked unorganized and the images did not fit nicely around the crossed words. I changed my design one last time to feature a staircase-like layout of carpets to draw the readers eye downward and follow the text. I also included a pomegranate as the logo for the museum, as the pomegranate is a symbol of Armenia. I changed the museum title from Helvetica to Spectral to increase credibility. I included "@ AEM" to emphasize that this is a museum, and not a travel agency, which the phrase "discover Armenia" might suggest:

![HomeStaggered](https://github.com/mysticaltofu/DH150-NATALIEMAZMANIAN/blob/main/HomeStaggered.png)

### Interface Design Decisions

I decided to go with Helvetica for most of the body text, as it is easy to read and gives off a friendly vibe online. For headings, I chose the serif font Spectral to give an impression of refinement. As this is a museum website, I wanted it to feel academic and professional. I almost wanted to give a vintage vibe, perhaps suggesting that museums have been around longer than the internet has been, and therefore should be treated with respect.

For color scheme, I pulled most of my inspiration from the Armenian carpets I featured on the home page. However, most of the website is black and off-white, as I prefer a minimalistic color pallete to let photos of museum artifacts stand out. The Armenian flag is red, blue, and orange: for this reason, I will be utilizing dark blue and shades of burgundy as sophisticated accent colors.

### Impression Test

#### Summary of Impression Test Results
Conducting the impression test was really valuable as I continue my design process moving forward. Ultimately, I learned that the website I have designed thus far gives a minimalistic, yet organized impression. It is of my concern that the site looks a bit too simple, so I was pleased to hear that it provided the necessary information while still having an attractive interace. However, I worry that my participant was just being nice to me, so I might get another opinion of a more harsh critic to determine if I should include more design elements. Overall, my tester concluded that the three main words he would use to describe the site are: informative, uncluttered, and pleasing.

### Accessibility Check: Color Contrast

The site meets accessibility WCAG2.0 AA level requirements:

### Four Distinctive Screen Designs

The screen designs below feature the pages dedicated to Collection Highlights, Collection Categories, Lecture, and Hours and Tickets:

### Cognitive Walkthrough
#### Results of Cognitive Walkthrough
[Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WLbZ9mQWy3U9Ml3M-LVmMtyzhwAxJE89f64EDea4VBc/edit?usp=sharing) are the results of the cognitive walkthrough that was done with two of my classmates.

#### Summary of Cognitive Walkthrough Findings
The cognitive walkthrough helped me to realize that the navigation bar/menu is the main part of the website that helps the user understand where they are and where they could choose to navigate to while using the website. My participants noted that the flow of the website was easy to understand. They also said that it is cohesive and pleasing to look at. Getting positive feedback from my classmates was encouraging and very nice to hear after working on this project for the duration of the quarter. Overall, they only had positive comments, so I did lack constructive feedback.

### Reflection
Summary of the process, what went smoothly or differently from your expectation
What you would change or design differently based on the feedback you got from the prototype testing.
