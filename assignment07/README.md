### Home Page Design Variations

Before settling on my final home page design, I went through a few iterations which are chronicled below.

### Trial :one:

I began designing with the idea of using Armenian carpets in mind, as they are visually appealing and could be used to draw the user in. At first, I began with a home page with typical centered text:

### Trial :two:

Experimenting with different layouts, I attempted to feature one carpet and showcase it on the center of the page:

### Trial :three:

Ultimately deciding that the design looked off balance and a bit too simple, I tried to do something more creative and experimented with a crossword design:

### Trial :four: - Final

This did not really work out very well, as the vertical text looked unorganized and the images did not fit nicely around the crossed words. I changed my design one last time to feature a staircase-like layout of carpets to draw the readers eye downward and follow the text. I included "@ AEM" to emphasize that this is a museum, and not a travel agency, which the phrase "discover Armenia" might suggest:

### Interface Design Decisions

I decided to go with Helvetica for most of the body text, as it is easy to read and gives off a friendly vibe online. For headings, I chose the serif font Spectral to give an impression of refinement. As this is a museum website, I wanted it to feel academic and professional. I almost wanted to give a vintage vibe, perhaps suggesting that museums have been around longer than the internet has been, and therefore should be treated with respect.

For color scheme, I pulled most of my inspiration from the Armenian carpets I featured on the home page. However, most of the website is black and off-white, as I prefer a minimalistic color pallete to let photos of museum artifacts stand out. The Armenian flag is red, blue, and orange: for this reason, I will be utilizing dark blue and shades of burgundy as sophisticated accent colors.

#### Summary of Impression Test Results
Conducting the impression test was really valuable as I continue my design process moving forward. Ultimately, I learned that the website I have designed thus far gives a minimalistic, yet organized impression. It is of my concern that the site looks a bit too simple, so I was pleased to hear that it provided the necessary information while still having an attractive interace. However, I worry that my participant was just being nice to me, so I might get another opinion of a more harsh critic to determine if I should include more design elements. Overall, my tester concluded that the three main words he would use to describe the site are: informative, uncluttered, and pleasing.

### Accessibility Check: Color Contrast

The site meets accessibility WCAG2.0 AA level requirements:
