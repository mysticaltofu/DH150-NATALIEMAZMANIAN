### Home Page Design Variations
I began designing with the idea of using Armenian carpets in mind, as they are visually appealing and could be used to draw the user in. At first, I began with a home page with typical centered text.

Experimenting with different layouts, I attempted to feature one carpet and showcase it on the center of the page.

Ultimately deciding that the design looked off balance and a bit too simple, I tried to do something more creative and experimented with a crossword design.

This did not really work out very well, as the vertical text looked unorganized and the images did not fit nicely around the crossed words. I changed my design one last time to feature a staircase-like layout of carpets to draw the readers eye downward and follow the text. I included "@ AEM" to emphasize that this is a museum, and not a travel agency, which the phrase "discover Armenia" might suggest.
