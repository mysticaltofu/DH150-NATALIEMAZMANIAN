# High Fidelity Prototype: Assignment 07
## Natalie Mazmanian :book: Course: Digital Humanities 150 

### Description of Project: Purpose and Process
the purpose and process of this prototyping phase (3-5 sentences)
The purposes of interactive prototype are 1) to visualize the information and interactive component in the limited screen size, so you will learn how to systematically evaluate tradeoffs of alternative ways you can design a component of a system; 2) to validify the interaction flow that the user's choice will branch out. During this process you will analyze factors that influence the design of user input and feedback in an interactive system and narrow down your design into polished artefact by examining the possible design ideas. You will use the prototype to communicate and test with others; also to reflect on your design activities in exploring a design space.

### Home Page Design Variations

Before settling on my final home page design, I went through a few iterations which are chronicled below.

### Trial :one:

I began designing with the idea of using Armenian carpets in mind, as they are visually appealing and could be used to draw the user in. At first, I began with a home page with typical centered text:

![HomeCentered](https://github.com/mysticaltofu/DH150-NATALIEMAZMANIAN/blob/main/HomeCentered.png)

### Trial :two:

Experimenting with different layouts, I attempted to feature one carpet and showcase it on the center of the page:

### Trial :three:

Ultimately deciding that the design looked off balance and a bit too simple, I tried to do something more creative and experimented with a crossword design:

### Trial :four: - Final

This did not really work out very well, as the vertical text looked unorganized and the images did not fit nicely around the crossed words. I changed my design one last time to feature a staircase-like layout of carpets to draw the readers eye downward and follow the text. I also included a pomegranate as the logo for the museum, as the pomegranate is a symbol of Armenia. I changed the museum title from Helvetica to Spectral to increase credibility. I included "@ AEM" to emphasize that this is a museum, and not a travel agency, which the phrase "discover Armenia" might suggest:

![HomeStaggered](https://github.com/mysticaltofu/DH150-NATALIEMAZMANIAN/blob/main/HomeStaggered.png)

### Interface Design Decisions

I decided to go with Helvetica for most of the body text, as it is easy to read and gives off a friendly vibe online. For headings, I chose the serif font Spectral to give an impression of refinement. As this is a museum website, I wanted it to feel academic and professional. I almost wanted to give a vintage vibe, perhaps suggesting that museums have been around longer than the internet has been, and therefore should be treated with respect.

For color scheme, I pulled most of my inspiration from the Armenian carpets I featured on the home page. However, most of the website is black and off-white, as I prefer a minimalistic color pallete to let photos of museum artifacts stand out. The Armenian flag is red, blue, and orange: for this reason, I will be utilizing dark blue and shades of burgundy as sophisticated accent colors.

### Impression Test

#### Summary of Impression Test Results
Conducting the impression test was really valuable as I continue my design process moving forward. Ultimately, I learned that the website I have designed thus far gives a minimalistic, yet organized impression. It is of my concern that the site looks a bit too simple, so I was pleased to hear that it provided the necessary information while still having an attractive interace. However, I worry that my participant was just being nice to me, so I might get another opinion of a more harsh critic to determine if I should include more design elements. Overall, my tester concluded that the three main words he would use to describe the site are: informative, uncluttered, and pleasing.

### Accessibility Check: Color Contrast

The site meets accessibility WCAG2.0 AA level requirements:

### Four Distinctive Screen Designs

The screen designs below feature the pages dedicated to Collection Highlights, Collection Categories, Lecture, and Hours and Tickets:
