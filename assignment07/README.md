### Home Page Design Variations

Before settling on my final home page design, I went through a few iterations which are chronicled below.

### Trial :one:

I began designing with the idea of using Armenian carpets in mind, as they are visually appealing and could be used to draw the user in. At first, I began with a home page with typical centered text:

### Trial :two:

Experimenting with different layouts, I attempted to feature one carpet and showcase it on the center of the page:

### Trial :three:

Ultimately deciding that the design looked off balance and a bit too simple, I tried to do something more creative and experimented with a crossword design:

### Trial :four: - Final

This did not really work out very well, as the vertical text looked unorganized and the images did not fit nicely around the crossed words. I changed my design one last time to feature a staircase-like layout of carpets to draw the readers eye downward and follow the text. I included "@ AEM" to emphasize that this is a museum, and not a travel agency, which the phrase "discover Armenia" might suggest:
