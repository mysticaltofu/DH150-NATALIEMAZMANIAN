#### Project Description

##### Design Challenge
The main user need/activity that my project would support is aleviating the confusion of navigating small museums' websites to find relevant information regarding galleries, ticket information, and volunteering opportunities. The basic need involved for this activity includes enriching the user's knowledge regarding niche topics that may only be covered at small museums. It also encourgaes more visitation and volunteering at these small organizations. The current solution to satisfy these needs includes word of mouth/trial and error/unclear websites. The limitations that possibly would be improved with technology include having equal access to all people interested, not wasting time in trial and error, and deriving accurate information with ease.

##### Target Users
The characteristics of the users include any individuals who are inclined to visit a museum. Demographically, the majority of users will likely be middle-aged/older adults. I predict that they will likely be educated, as they are using their free time to visit a museum. Users would utilize the museum website at home, likely before or after their trip. They could also engage with the website en route to the museum, seeking last minute ticket information. To complete the activity, users would probably engage with the website in a manner of trial and error until they find the relevant information to their task.

##### Research Method
I used participatory observation, as I, the observer, was interacting with the partipant herself.

#### Transcript
Here is the transcript of the video interview.

#### Reflection
Interviewing participants is actually something I quite enjoy. Getting to see how an individual interacts with an interface is not something that is usually observed, so I find it eye-opening to see how different people (particularly in different demographics) use the internet. I learned that some participants may elaborate a lot, and others may keep their answers more concise, so it is important to chunk a good amount of time to interview but also be prepared to end early. My original interview participant bailed last minute, so I also learned that it is important to have back ups. I also learned that Zoom takes double the amount of time to process on the cloud, so I should make sure I have enough time to compile my materials post interview. The participant had a lot of insightful comments, and hearing his perspective on what would make a website better was valuable.
