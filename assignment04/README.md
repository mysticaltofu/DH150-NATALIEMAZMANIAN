#### Project Description

##### Design Challenge
What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?
What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

##### Target Users
The characteristics of the users include any individuals who are inclined to visit a museum. Demographically, the majority of users will likely be middle-aged/older adults. I predict that they will likely be educated, as they are using their free time to visit a museum. Users would utilize the museum website at home, likely before or after their trip. They could also engage with the website en route to the museum, seeking last minute ticket information. To complete the activity, users would probably engage with the website in a manner of trial and error until they find the relevant information to their task.

##### Research Method
I used participatory observation, as I, the observer, was interacting with the partipant herself.
